[Hacker News Summary](https://hackernews.betacat.io/) leverages AI technology to extract summaries
and illustrations from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
articles, providing a seamless news scanning experience.

Summaries are primarily generated by
ChatGPT [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) model, and fallback to
local [GoogleT5](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) model when ChatGPT is not available.

## Features

* Clear and easily understandable summaries generated by our advanced AI assistant
* Relevant illustrations make articles easily scannable and visually engaging
* Common video sites, PDFs, and GitHub gists are seamlessly embedded
* Flexibility to sort articles based on their score, comment count, or publication time
* RSS feeds fully supported ([#14](https://github.com/polyrabbit/hacker-news-digest/issues/14), [#19](https://github.com/polyrabbit/hacker-news-digest/issues/19))
* Local translation (Chinese)

Emoji explained:

* ‚ù§Ô∏è: point - upvotes received from the Hacker News community
* üë§: user - Hacker News user who submitted this post
* üïò: submission time - a human-readable time indicating when the post was submitted
* üí¨: comment count - comments posted by the community, click to visit this comment page
* üîó: source of the news - where the news originated
* üì∞: summary model - which model is used to generate the summary, options
  are `OpenAI`, `GoogleT5` and `Prefix`

## How it works

[Hacker News Summary](https://hackernews.betacat.io/) is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. It
performs the following periodic actions:

1. Parsing the Hacker News page to obtain a list of news articles
2. Extracting the main content from each news article using
   a [score algorithm](%5Btutorial%5D%20How-to-extract-main-content-from-web-pages-using-Machine-Learning.ipynb)
3. Finding the most suitable illustration for each article and making a local copy
4. Generating summaries of the article's content using OpenAI API or invoking a local model as a
   fallback when the API is unavailable
5. Rendering a template that incorporates the illustrations and summaries, and deploying it to
   GitHub Pages

## Localization

Translation is also performed by ChatGPT, with a single extra step in the prompt. Currently supported languages:

## TODO

- [ ] A better way to scrap websites (maybe PhantomJS & Selenium)
- [ ] Also summarize comments ([see discussions on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36260140))
- [ ] Switch to [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
- [ ] A more beautiful home page (maybe in HTML9)
- [ ] Discover an alternative local models for generating summaries
- [X] Sort articles by score/comment/time
- [X] RSS
- [X] Deploy on github pages
- [X] Have a good sleep !important
