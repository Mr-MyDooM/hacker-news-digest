This service extracts summaries and illustrations from [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) articles for people who want to get the most out of hacker news while cutting down the time spent on deciding which one to read and which to skip.

Also see my guide on [How to extract main content from web pages using Machine-Learning](%5Btutorial%5D%20How-to-extract-main-content-from-web-pages-using-Machine-Learning.ipynb).

### Features
* A responsive and modern interface that fits well on mobile phones
* Summaries and images make articles scannable
* Common video sites, PDFs and gists of github are embedded directly
* Subdomains and their lovely favicons are also shown
* Sort articles by score/comment/time
* RSS feed can be customized by score and keyword

### Talk is cheap, illustrate what it can do for me!
